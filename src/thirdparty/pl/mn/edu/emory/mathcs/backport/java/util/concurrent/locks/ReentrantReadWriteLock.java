/**
 * An implementation of {@link ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
 * semantics to {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * <p>This class has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Acquisition order</b>
 *
 * <p>The order of entry to the
 * lock need not be in arrival order. If readers are
 * active and a writer enters the lock then no subsequent readers will
 * be granted the read lock until after that writer has acquired and
 * released the write lock.
 *
 * DEPARTURE FROM java.util.concurrent: this implementation is implemented
 * as writer-preferring and thus its acquisition order may be different
 * than in java.util.concurrent.
 *
 * <li><b>Reentrancy</b>
 * <p>This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
 * write locks in the style of a {@link ReentrantLock}. Readers are not
 * allowed until all write locks held by the writing thread have been
 * released.
 * <p>Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock - but not vice-versa.
 * Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful when
 * write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
 * perform reads under read locks.
 * If a reader tries to acquire the write lock it will never succeed.
 *
 * <li><b>Lock downgrading</b>
 * <p>Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
 * by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
 * write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
 * <b>not</b> possible.
 *
 * <li><b>Interruption of lock acquisition</b>
 * <p>The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
 * acquisition.
 *
 * <li><b>{@link Condition} support</b>
 * <p>The write lock provides a {@link Condition} implementation that
 * behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
 * {@link Condition} implementation provided by
 * {@link ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * This {@link Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.
 * <p>The read lock does not support a {@link Condition} and
 * <tt>readLock().newCondition()</tt> throws
 * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.
 *
 * <li><b>Instrumentation</b>
 * <P> This class supports methods to determine whether locks
 * are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
 * system state, not for synchronization control.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usages</b>. Here is a code sketch showing how to exploit
 * reentrancy to perform lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception
 * handling is elided for simplicity):
 * <pre>
 * class CachedData {
 *   Object data;
 *   volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *   ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *   void processCachedData() {
 *     rwl.readLock().lock();
 *     if (!cacheValid) {
 *        // upgrade lock manually
 *        rwl.readLock().unlock();   // must unlock first to obtain writelock
 *        rwl.writeLock().lock();
 *        if (!cacheValid) { // recheck
 *          data = ...
 *          cacheValid = true;
 *        }
 *        // downgrade lock
 *        rwl.readLock().lock();  // reacquire read without giving up write lock
 *        rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // unlock write, still hold read
 *     }
 *
 *     use(data);
 *     rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
 * uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
 * only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
 * more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
 * overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
 * is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
 * concurrently accessed.
 *
 * <pre>
 * class RWDictionary {
 *    private final Map&lt;String, Data&gt;  m = new TreeMap&lt;String, Data&gt;();
 *    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *    private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
 *    private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
 *
 *    public Data get(String key) {
 *        r.lock(); try { return m.get(key); } finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public String[] allKeys() {
 *        r.lock(); try { return m.keySet().toArray(); } finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public Data put(String key, Data value) {
 *        w.lock(); try { return m.put(key, value); } finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public void clear() {
 *        w.lock(); try { m.clear(); } finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 *
 * <p>A reentrant write lock intrinsically defines an owner and can
 * only be released by the thread that acquired it.  In contrast, in
 * this implementation, the read lock has no concept of ownership, and
 * there is no requirement that the thread releasing a read lock is
 * the same as the one that acquired it.  However, this property is
 * not guaranteed to hold in future implementations of this class.
 *
 * <p> This lock supports a maximum of 65536 recursive write locks
 * and 65536 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
